# Hi everyone at GitHub!

My name is Nelson Lima and i\'m a Computer Science and Computer Networks student at UNIPE and IFPB, respectively. I\'ve been learning how to write code since march 2022, while i was at the end of law school. Actually, i didn\'t complete it. As the matter of fact, i didn\'t **really** like law school, except for the phylosophic part - i liked phylosophy, sociology, politics and athropology, but i didn\'t see myself working with law at all. Also, i\'m a musician. Before i started at IT, i was playing the keyboard with a localy famous female country singer for a living. By the end of the year of 2022, i was writing code instead of writing my paper on human rights and cryptography. **I really felt in love with proggramming**. Now i\'m focussing exclusively on my tech studies. It\'s hard for me to evaluate myself as a developer. So, even though i learn things **really fast**, i guess i'm at a begginner level yet. Well, you can see my codes for yourself and tell. Everything i\'ve been doing code-wise is right here at my GitHub. You can be my guest!

### My top interests are:

- Software engeneering
- Backend developing
- Networks
- Cryptography
- Cybersecurity

### Things i do for fun (code-wise):

I have nothing against Visual Studio Code or any other IDE, but i use VIM. Mostly because it felt that if i learn to do things by the hardest path, or from scratch, i would become a better developer. I actually love to customize my ".vimrc", make my own shortcuts and writing custom syntax plugins as well. Also, i love how fast VIM is and, the most important, i love how badass i look proggramming at it. Also, i have lots of fun creating virtual machines and doing some experiments with those machines. And, even though i rather code backend over frontend, aesthetics is a really important part of my workflow. I love letting my envirognment as beautiful, simple and functional as i can. E.G. that\'s a typical view i have while coding:
