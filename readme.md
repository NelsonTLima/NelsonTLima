# Hi everyone at GitHub!

I started programming as a self-taught enthusiast and now I am enrolled in two colleges: Computer Science at UNIPE and Computer Networks at IFPB. I am passionate about accumulating knowledge and understanding how things work. Currently, my primary programming language is Python, but I can also code in JavaScript, C, Rust, and use MySQL, HTML, and CSS. Prior to transitioning to technology, I had a background in humanities, studying Law and also worked as a musician, so creativity and communication skills are some of my strenghts. Nowadays, my interests revolve around software development, network infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

Let's code something together?
